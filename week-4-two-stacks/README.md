### Assignment: Searching for a Tax Document in a Stack Using Two Stacks

#### Objective:

Search for a specific tax document in a stack using two stacks. Maintain the original order of all other documents in the stack.

#### Problem Statement:

You have a **stack of tax documents** represented as an array. Your task is to:

1. Use **two stacks** to search for a specific tax document by its title.
2. Ensure that, after searching, the original order of the documents in the stack remains unchanged.
3. If the document is found, return the document. If not, return `null`.

### Key Concept:

- **Maintain the order**: The original order of the documents must be preserved after the search, even if the document is found or not.
